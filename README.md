## Documentation

This project is built using the [discord.js module](https://discord.js.org/). It
generally follows a typical discord.js project structure.

If you are looking to get started understanding the code, it is recommended to
first familiarize yourself with
[discord.js's documentation](https://discord.js.org/docs/packages/discord.js/14.14.1).
It is very helpful, and will explain most of the background needed to understand
this repo.

The code QA is done with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). It is strongly recommended to use Visual Studio Code with the [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extensions installed to work on this project.

The Bekt clan currently hosts the bot's live application code on [Railway](https://railway.app/) (we maintain both a production and test environment).
